I need to know if the python and sql code snippets below reflect the explinations below.  act as a professional coder to make sure it all lines up:

import pandas as pd

# load the csv file
df = pd.read_csv("lab_results_raw.csv")

# clean up the column names
df.columns = df.columns.str.strip()
df.columns = df.columns.str.lower()

# make sure collected_at is a datetime
df["collected_at"] = pd.to_datetime(df["collected_at"])

# save to parquet
df.to_parquet("lab_results_tidy.parquet")

-- count how many samples per assay in the last 30 days

SELECT a.assay_name,
       COUNT(*) AS n
FROM results r
INNER JOIN assays a
    ON r.assay_id = a.id
WHERE r.collected_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY a.assay_name
ORDER BY n DESC;


These code snippets are foundational examples of a data cleaning workflow using the pandas library in Python and using a SQL query to search for popular assay results
Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
This script takes raw lab results from a CSV, cleans them up a bit, and saves them in a faster Parquet format for analysis.
We start by importing pandas—the go-to library for working with tabular data in Python.


Next, we read the CSV into a DataFrame—think “smart spreadsheet” we can query and transform.


Then we standardize headers by trimming spaces and lowercasing so code is consistent.


We convert collected_at from text into real datetimes, which unlocks time-based analysis.


Finally, we write to Parquet, a compact, analytics-friendly format that’s faster than CSV.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the SQL query does:
This query counts how many results each assay had in the last 30 days and lists the busiest assays at the top.
We want each assay and how many records it has—so we select the name and a row count.


We join results to assays to attach human-readable names to each result via IDs.


We limit the dataset to results collected in the last 30 days to keep it current.


We group by assay name so the count is per assay, not the whole table.


We sort from highest to lowest to see the most active assays at the top.
